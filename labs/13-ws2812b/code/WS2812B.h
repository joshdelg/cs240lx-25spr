 * engler: possible interface fo ws2812b light strip, cs240lx
 *
 * the low-level "driver" code for the WS2812B addressable LED light strip.  
 *      Datasheet in docs/WS2812B
 *
 * the higher level support stuff is in neopix.c
 * 
 * Key sentence  missing from most documents:
 *	Addressing is indirect: you don’t pass a NeoPixel’s address
 *	via SPI. Instead the order of data in the frame provides the
 *	addressing: the first three color values are taken by the first
 *	NeoPixel in line, the second set of values by the next NeoPixel,
 *	the third by the third and so on.
 *		--- https://developer.electricimp.com/resources/neopixels
 *
 * 	I.e., it's not a FIFO buffer, the first thing you write gets claimed
 *	by the first LED, etc.
 * 
 * to send a:
 *	- 0 = T0H, T0L
 * 	- 1 = T1H, T1L
 * 	- FLUSH = how long to wait with voltage low to flush it out.
 *
 * One way to communicate more information with a device is to use a fancier
 * protocol (e.g., SPI, I2C).  A simpler hack is to use time --- there's a lot 
 * of information you can encode in various numbers of nanoseconds.    
 *
 * The WS2812B uses time as follows:
 *      To send a 1 bit: write a 1 for T1H, then a 0 for T0H.
 *      To send a 0 bit: write a 1 for T1L, then a 0 for T0L.
 *
 * The protocol:
 *   - Each pixel needs 3 bytes of information (G,R,B) [in that order] 
 *     for the color.  
 *   - The first 3 bytes you sent get claimed by the first pixel, 
 *     the second 3 bytes by the second, and so forth.
 *   - You then hold the communication pin low for FLUSH cycles to 
 *     tell the pixel you are done.
 *  
 * The data sheet for WS2812B says the following timings: 
 *      T0H    0: .35us +- .15us
 *      T1H    1: .9us +- .15us
 *      T0L    0: .9us +- .15us
 *      T1L    1: .35us +- .15us
 *      Trst = 80us 
 *
 * The above timings work. However, for long light strings, they can 
 * consume significant time.   Ideally we'd like to push the times as 
 * low as possible so that we can set/unset more pixels per second.   
 * The following *seem* to work on the light strings I have, but could
 * break on others (or could break on mine with the wrong set of pixels).   
 * Use with caution:
 *      T0H = 200ns + eps
 *      T1H = 750ns + eps
 *      T0L = 750ns + eps
 *      T1L = 200ns + eps

// i would suggest making a seperate copy you can flip between.
// why optimize:
//      the serial, time-based WS2812B protocl has the downside that 
//      everything is (obviously) O(n) based on the number of pixels 
//      --- the longer the delays for each pixel, the slower we can write
//      the entire strip.  general approach: sleazily cut down the 
//      delays to the lowest that seem to consistently work.  for a long
//      light strip this can add up.
