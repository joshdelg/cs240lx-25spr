## Instruction level profiler

When I was a kid, we had a useful instruction-level profiler "pixie" on
SGI workstations that would do binary rewriting and count the exact number
of times you ran each individual machine code instruction in your code.
It was exact in that it counted everything, rather than a statistical profiler
like `gprof` that only sampled.

Pixie was great.  There was nothing I couldn't speed up by many factors
if I used it.  There is some chance that without it I wouldn't have
gotten into MIT for grad school (and thus here to this lab) since my
demonstrated competence was making stuff fast and without pixie this
would have been hard.  So I have a fondness for it.

Of course, SGI died and binaries became hard to rewrite so you probably
haven't used anything like it.  Also, such things generally don't run
on kernel code.

So today we'll build a simple version.  Using the ARM single-stepping
hardware makes it pretty easy.  If you add the counters from the ARM
performance monitor, things get interesting in that its easy to see why
different parts of the code are taking longer than others.  And it's
not to hard to make it run on kernel code.

External motivation:
  - It's midterm week so we are keeping labs a bit light.
  - You'll need to understand single stepping next week when we build 
    our memory tracing tools (they use it).  A profiler is a nice
    way to kick the hardware around and see how things work.

Useful 140e labs:
  - [single-step][single-step]: this discusses the single step hardware
    and how to build the breakpoint veneer.
  - [interrupts][interrupts]: this gives a working interrupt lab and discusses
    shadow registers.

Checkoff:
  1. Write a simple profiler similar to the `gprof` in 140e
  2. Add the cycle counter and display both the number of times 
     each instruction runs and the cycle counts.
  3. Maybe: Add the value of some interesting hardware counters to (2).

There are tons of extensions.  Will add!  Or ask.

------------------------------------------------------------------
### Background: Single step example: `code/`

We give a complete working single-step example in the `code/`
directory. It's called "ss-pixie" (single-step pixie) in honor of its
ancestor.

The code has two public routines:
  - `pixie_start()`: start single step tracing
  - `unsigned pixie_stop()`: stop tracing and return the number of instructions
    executed.

At a high level it works by using "mismatch faults" to single-step
through code between these two calls.

As you might recall from 140e (labs 9, 10, 11), mismatch faults only
happen when for code running at user level, so at a high level the code
works as follows:

  1. `pixie_start`: sets up the exception vectors to catch both mismatch
     faults and system calls (see below), turns on the debug hardware
     and mismatch faulting and finally switches to user mode.  (i.e.,
     sets the mode field in `cpsr` register mode to `0b10000`)
  2. As soon as the code starts running at user level it will get a mismatch 
     fault, which will get vectored to the "prefetch abort" handler.  
     This handler counts the instructions and and sets a mismatch
     on the faulting instruction (so that the faulting instruction
     will execute normally, but any other instruction will fault).
  3. When the code wants to turn off profiling it calls `pixie_stop` to turn
     off mismatching and switch back to privileged mode.
    
     Note, `pixie_stop` can't do either directly since it is at user
     level --- instead it does a system call to elevate privileges,
     and the system call handler turns off the faults, switches back to
     the original privileged mode, and return back to the calling code.

You should poke around the example.  It's heavily commented.

------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 1: turn `ss-pixie` into an instruction profiler

Modify the `ss-pixie` code to count how many times each instruction
gets run.
  1. You can get the faulting PC address from the 15th register.
  2. Similar to the `gprof` code you wrote in 140e, you'll add an
     array that is the size of the code segment and increment it each
     time an instruction runs.

The basic algorithm:

 1. Use `kmalloc` (or, better: your ckalloc!) to allocate an array at
    least as big as the code.  (If you use kmalloc make sure to do
    `kmalloc_init` first.)  Compute the code size using the labels defined
    in `libpi/memmap` (we give C definitions in `libpi/include/memmap.h`).

 2. In the fault handler, use the program counter value (register 15)
    to index into this array and increment the associated count.  

    NOTE: its very easy to mess up sizes.  Each instruction is 4 bytes,
    so you'll divide the `pc` by 4.  You'll want to subtract where the
    code starts (0x800).

 3. `pixie_dump(N)`: the easiest acceptable way to build this is to 
    just dump out any instruction with a higher than N count in order.
    We will take this.

    A more client friendly implementation is to print out the top,
    sorted, non-zero values in this array along with the `pc` value they
    correspond to.

    In any case: You should be able to look in the disassembled code
    (the `.list` file for each routine) to see which instruction these
    correspond to.

 4. For the simple test `tests/1-prof-test.c` that just repeatedly prints,
    the expected results are most counts should be in `PUT32`, `GET32`,
    and various `uart` routines.  Note: you will get different 
    results when you have caching enabled or not (why?).

Write a couple tests and validate that your profiler eats them and spits
out interesting values.  For interesting tests, please post to Ed so we
can steal them (add your name / year).

#### To add your ckalloc

If you want to use your ckalloc, and you finished lab 6 (as in: you
use your code in the makefile rather than staff binaries), you can just
change the Makefile in `9-profiler/code/Makefile` to pull it in:

        CFLAGS += -I../../6-debug-alloc/code/
        COMMON_SRC += ../../6-debug-alloc/code/ckalloc.c
        COMMON_SRC += ../../6-debug-alloc/code/kr-malloc.c
        COMMON_SRC += ../../6-debug-alloc/code/ck-gc.c
        COMMON_SRC += ../../6-debug-alloc/code/gc-asm.S

Note: you really shouldn't need the gc stuff.  Unfortunately `kr-malloc`
needs `sbrk` which we foolishly put in `ck-gc.c`.  A good approach is to 
pull it apart so it's seperate.

Otherwise you have to copy it into a subdirectory and use it.

#### A great extension!   

Have a wrapper around `my-install` that uses passes each PC address to
the GNU utility `arm-none-eabi-addr2line` to convert the addresses to
file and line number information.  You can even open the given files
and display the code on one side, and the counts on the other side.
(Super useful!)

For example, when I run `1-prof-test.c` with caching enabled I get:

        ...a bunch of values...

	    pc=0x96d4: cnt=164
	    pc=0x96d8: cnt=164
	    pc=0x96dc: cnt=164
	    pc=0x96e0: cnt=164
	    pc=0x96e4: cnt=164
	    pc=0x96e8: cnt=164
	    pc=0x96ec: cnt=164

        ...another bunch of values...


When I use "addr2line" to get the file and function of the first address
`0x96d4` by running:

        % arm-none-eabi-addr2line 0x96d4 -s -f  \
                  -e objs/l1/l2/l3/tests/1-prof-test.elf

I get:

        uart_can_putc
        uart.c:159

Which makes sense --- mostly the code is waiting to be able to emit 
output.

------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 2: add support for cycle counters

Counting instructions is good, but we would also like to count the number
of cycles each instruction costs.  When there is a big difference between 
these it's interesting.

We have cycle counter routines in `libpi/include/cycle-count.h` so it
might seem easy.  Unfortunately, our single step handler does so much 
compared to running a single instruction that just recording them would
be useless.

Ideally, what we would want to do instead is:
  1. As the first line of the fault handler, record the cycle count.
  2. At the last line of the fault handler, record the cycle count.
  3. Subtracting (1) from (2)  gives the difference.  (Note, of course,
     by Heisenberg that there will still be perturbations, but if
     small enough, it gets more deterministic and we can subtract it).

How can we do this?  Various problems:
  1. How can we read the cycle counter when we get an exception?
     All the registers are live!  Fortunately, while we can't use `lr`,
     we have a private `sp` and since the ARM registers are untyped we
     can read into it.  (Weird, but legal.)  

  2. Ok, we have the cycle counter in `sp`: how do we store it?  We
     need a stack to push it onto, but the stack needs `sp`.

     Fortunately, the arm1176 provides (at least) three coprocessor
     registers for "process and thread id's."  However, since the
     values are not interpreted by the hardware, they can be used to
     store arbitrary values.  The screenshot of the manual below gives
     the instructions.

  3. Ok: so what about at the end?  We need the closet possible value
     to when we jump back.  If we put this in sp, we won't have any
     place to do the read in (1).   As you probably guessed we can put 
     it in one of the other scratch registers.  (Or maybe do something
     more clever?)

     Thus, given (2) and (3) we can compute the number of cycles in
     the handler.

What to do:
  1. Use the scratch registers to record the cycle counter at the 
     start and end of the handler.  Try to write the code so 
     the reads are as close to the start and end as possible.

  2. You'll have to subtract off a correction factor.  The cleaner
     step 1 is, the more stable this factor will be.

  3. Write some simple code that you know the answer to and validate
     that you get useful answers.

Note: this is a good reason to reach chapter 3 of the arm1176:
there are all sorts of weirdo little operations that when you
add cleverness can let you do neat stuff not possible on a
general purpose OS.

------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 3: Implement PMU counters

***When you get here do a pull: filling stuff in***

The arm1176 has a bunch of interesting performance counters
we can use to see what is going on, such as cache misses, TLB misses,
prediction misses, procedure calls.  You'll write a simple library that
exposes these, which will make it much easier to optimize code.

The arm1176 document describes the performance monitor unit (PMU) on pages
3-133 --- 3-140.  It has many useful performance counters, though with the
limit that only two can be enabled at any time in addition to the "always
on" cycle counter.  We'll write a simple interface to expose these.

These counters make it much easier to speed up your code --- it's hard to
know the right optimization when you don't know what the bottleneck is.
In addition, they can be used to test your understanding of the hardware
--- if you believe you understand how the BTB, TLB, or cache works, write
code based on this understanding and measure if the expected result is
the actual.

#### Implement `code/armv6-pmu.h`

Fill in the `unimplemented` routines in `code/armv6-pmu.h`.  I'd suggest
using the `cp_asm` macros in

        #include "asm-helpers.h"

You probably should have an enum for all the different types in
the header too.  E.g.,

        enum {
            PMU_INST_CNT = 0x7,
            ...
        };

What you need:
   1. Performance monitor control register (3-133): write this to
      select which performance counters to use (the values are in tabel
      3-137) and to enable the PMU at all.
   2. Cycle counter register (3-137): read this to get the current
      cycle count.
   3. Count register 0 (3-138): read this to get the 32-bit 0-event
      counter (set in step 1).
   4. Count register 1 (3-139): read this to get the 32-bit 1-event
      counter (set in step 1).


### Write some code that shows off some of the other performance counters.

This is a choose-your-own adventure:  look through the counters and
write some code that shows off something they can measure (or run on your
140e or 240lx code!).  The easiest way is to copy the header files into
`libpi/include` directory and they should just work.

------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 4: Use PMU counters in your profiler

***When you get here do a pull: filling stuff in***

For this, you'll take the assembly from part 3 and add the counters
to the prefetch abort fault handler trampoline.
